# AI Text Humanization Technical Documentation

## Architecture Overview

- Clean Architecture implementation with clear separation of concerns
- Core business logic isolated from external dependencies
- Modular transformation pipeline with extensible components

## Components

1. Text Transformation Pipeline
2. AI/ML Models Integration
3. Authenticity Verification System
4. Mathematical Models
5. Performance Optimization

## Performance Metrics

- Response time: <500ms for texts up to 1000 words
- Authenticity score: >85% pass rate
- Resource usage: <100MB RAM per instance

## Scaling Considerations

- Horizontal scaling with stateless design
- Caching strategy for frequent transformations
- Rate limiting and load balancing
